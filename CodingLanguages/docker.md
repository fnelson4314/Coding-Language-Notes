## Docker

## What is Docker

- Docker is a tool for running applications in an isolated environment, similar to a virtual machine
- Docker uses containers which are an abstraction at the app layer that packages code and dependencies together. Multiple containers can run on the same machine and share the OS kernel with other containers, each running as isolated processes in user spaces.
